Knowledge transfer document for the ER diagram -

The data schema or erd diagram showcases different main entities present in the system and
supporting entities and relations between them. There are also lookup tables which provide
some descriptive information about the entities.
Main Entities:
Artist: Artist table is a table which stores artist and all corresponding details of the artist and
also holds many relations mostly being with the support entities which provide additional details
about the artist and also relations with other main entities.
Venue: Venue schema totally deals with venue details and also includes brief details in Lu
tables associated with them. They also have relations with other major tables for holding
important information about the events.
Bluecard: Bluecard is a major entity which holds information of all events taking place with
many foreign connections with all other major entities and it acts as main entity for the project as
it contains the information of events.
Presenter:It holds information about presenters of the event and other associated details of
presenters.
NationalOffer:This set of tables are related to the national offers which provide major
information about finance and other money related details to the bluecard table i.e the events.
Contract:These tables contain all major information about the contracts issued in the system.
Financial Tables : This is a complex set of tables not having one main table. They have many
tables with different financial details associated with different entities and events. The
wholesomely provide a ledger kind of information which has all the financial information of the
system.
Agent : There is a small yet so important entity in the ERD which has information about agent
programs which in turn are used for agent details.
AppUser : This set of tables are used to give information about app users and very much
important in understanding feedback.
Lead : This table has information about lead agents .
Apart from these main entities and direct supporting entities there are also some entities used
by main entities such as contact information, communication, weblinks etc. Lu tables which are
lookup tables are very important to the system as they provide feedback related information
which helps in the analysis part.
Overview of Key Entities:
Lead to Presenter: Leads are potential clients. When they decide to move forward, they convert
into Presenters.
Presenter, Artist, Venue, and Event: These are the main entities involved in organizing an event.
Presenters book Artists and Venues through the Event entity, and these arrangements are
formalized in Contracts.
Blue Card: This entity ensures that all parties (Artists, Venues) comply with necessary
regulations or certifications.
Contract to Accounting: Contracts detail the financial agreements, and Accounting tracks the
money flow, ensuring all transactions are recorded and linked to the correct contracts.
Connection types between tables:
A >|----------||- B:
A >o---------||- B:
A +o---------||- B:
A >o--------o+ B:
A >|----------||- B:
Explanation: This represents a one-to-one relationship between A and B.
>|: The ">" denotes that A can optionally participate in the relationship (i.e., not all instances of A
are involved in the relationship). The "|" represents that exactly one instance of A participates if
it does participate.
||: On the side of B, the "||" means that B must participate exactly once (mandatory
participation).
Meaning: This means that A can optionally be linked to exactly one instance of B, and B must
be linked to exactly one instance of A.
Type: One-to-One relationship (optional for A but mandatory for B).
A >o---------||- B:
Explanation: This represents a many-to-one (N:1) relationship.
>o: The "o" denotes optional participation from A, meaning an instance of A may or may not be
involved in the relationship. The ">" represents multiple instances (the "many" side).
||: On the side of B, the "||" means that B must participate exactly once in the relationship.
Meaning: This means that multiple instances of A can optionally be linked to exactly one
instance of B, and B must be linked to one or more instances of A.
Type: Many-to-One (optional for A, mandatory for B).
A +o---------||- B:
Explanation: This represents a one-to-one relationship, similar to the first example, but with
optional participation on both sides.
+o: The "+" means the relationship is unique for A (one instance only), and "o" indicates optional
participation for A (it may or may not participate in the relationship).
||: On the side of B, the "||" means that B must participate exactly once.
Meaning: This means that each instance of A can optionally be linked to exactly one instance of
B, but every instance of B must be linked to one A.
Type: One-to-One (optional for A, mandatory for B).
A >o--------o+ B:
Explanation: This represents a many-to-many (M) relationship.
>o: The "o" denotes optional participation for A, and the ">" represents multiple instances (the
"many" side).
o+: On the side of B, the "+" means the relationship is unique for B (each instance of B has a
unique link), and "o" indicates optional participation from B as well.
Meaning: This means that multiple instances of A can optionally be linked to multiple instances
of B, and both sides can have optional participation.
Type: Many-to-Many (optional participation for both A and B).
Summary of Connections:
A >|----------||- B: One-to-One (optional for A, mandatory for B).
A >o---------||- B: Many-to-One (optional for A, mandatory for B).
A +o---------||- B: One-to-One (optional for A, mandatory for B).
A >o--------o+ B: Many-to-Many (optional for both A and B).
To focus on data flow explanations and other relevant information, we can break it down into
several key areas:
1. Data Flow Explanation
Understanding how data moves through the system is crucial for grasping the entire architecture
of your project. Here’s how you can document the data flow:
a. Data Entry Points
● Blue Card Creation:
○ Data Inputs: The process begins when a Blue Card is created. Data such as the
presenter’'s details, event information, and venue details are entered.
○ Primary Entities Involved: BlueCard, Artist, Presenter, Venue.
● Artist Enrollment:
○ Data Inputs: When an artist enrolls in a program, data regarding the artist,
program, and enrollment specifics are captured.
○ Primary Entities Involved: ArtistProgramEnroll, ArtistProgram,
Artist.
● Contract Creation:
○ Data Inputs: When a contract is created, information about the agreement
between the artist, presenter, and venue is captured.
○ Primary Entities Involved: Contract, Artist, Presenter, Venue.
b. Data Processing
● Promo and Marketing:
○ Data Flow: Information from the BlueCardPromo, BlueCardPromoArtist,
and related entities is processed to generate promotional materials.
○ Key Processes: This includes generating promo content, linking artists to
specific promos, and creating web links or files associated with the promo.
● Financial Transactions:
○ Data Flow: Financial data flows through various entities, including
ContractPayment, AgentPayment, PayrollBatch, and related tables.
○ Key Processes: Payment processing, commission calculations, and payroll
management are handled in this phase.
● Contract Management:
○ Data Flow: Data related to contracts moves through entities such as Contract,
ContractArtist, ContractTransaction, and ContractEventDate.
○ Key Processes: Contract creation, amendments, and event management are
processed here.
c. Data Storage and Retrieval
● Centralized Storage:
○ Entities Involved: Most of the data is stored across entities like BlueCard,
Contract, Artist, Presenter, and Venue.
○ Data Retrieval: Data can be retrieved for reporting, analysis, or further
processing through queries against these entities.
● Historical Data:
○ Entities Involved: Historical data might be stored in entities like
ArchivedContracts, OldEventDetails, or PastArtistPrograms.
○ Data Retrieval: Useful for generating reports on past performances, events, or
financial summaries.
2. Relevant Information for our Project
In addition to data flow, it’s important to understand other aspects that might be relevant for our
project:
a. System Interactions
● Internal Systems:
○ The ER diagram likely represents an internal system where different modules
interact with each other. For example, the Artist Module interacts with the Venue
and Contract Modules.
● External Systems:
○ There could be interactions with external systems, especially for handling
payments, marketing campaigns, or external event management tools.
b. Data Integrity and Validation
● Foreign Key Constraints:
○ The relationships between entities ensure data integrity. For example, each
BlueCard must be associated with valid Artist, Presenter, and Venue
entries.
● Data Validation:
○ Before data is processed (e.g., contract creation, artist enrollment), validation
checks should ensure that all required fields are complete and meet predefined
criteria.
c. Security and Permissions
● Access Control:
○ Define who has access to which parts of the system. For instance, only certain
roles might be allowed to create or modify contracts, while others can only view
them.
● Sensitive Data:
○ Data such as payment information, artist personal details, and contract terms
should be securely stored and transmitted.
d. Reporting and Analytics
● Performance Reports:
○ Generate reports on artist performances, event success rates, financial
summaries, and other key metrics.
● Dashboards:
○ Implement dashboards for real-time monitoring of ongoing events, financials, and
contract statuses.
e. Auditing and Logging
● Change Tracking:
○ Implement logs to track changes made to key entities like Contract,
BlueCard, Artist, etc.
● Audit Trails:
○ Maintain an audit trail to trace back any modifications or transactions, which is
crucial for both security and compliance.
Identifying fact and dimension tables is a key step in designing a data warehouse, especially for
reporting and analytics. Here’s how we can identify them in your ER diagram:
1. Fact Tables
Fact tables are the core of a star or snowflake schema in a data warehouse. They typically
contain quantitative data (measures) that are used for analysis and are often at the intersection
of several dimension tables. In your ER diagram, the following entities might be considered as
fact tables:
● BlueCard:
○ This table could serve as a fact table as it likely records the core event data, such
as event type, venue, budget, etc. Each record in the BlueCard could be an
"event" that occurred, with measures such as budget and number of attendees.
● Contract:
○ Contracts can also be treated as fact tables, especially in cases where the
contract details (such as amounts, dates, and involved parties) are central to the
analysis. The measures here could include the total contract amount,
commission percentages, and payments made.
● NationalOffer:
○ This table could be considered a fact table if you are analyzing offers on a
national scale. Measures might include offer amount, number of offers per region,
and the success rate of those offers.
● ArtistProgramEnroll:
○ This table could serve as a fact table if you’re analyzing artist enrollments in
programs. Measures could include the number of enrollments, the total revenue
from enrollments, etc.
2. Dimension Tables
Dimension tables contain descriptive attributes (or fields) related to the fact data. They are used
to filter, group, and label facts in queries. In your ER diagram, the following entities might serve
as dimension tables:
● Artist:
○ This table provides detailed information about artists, such as their names,
addresses, and agency information. It’s a classic dimension table, allowing you to
slice your data by different artist attributes.
● Venue:
○ This table contains information about venues, including names, locations, and
capacities. It helps in analyzing events or contracts based on where they took
place.
● Presenter:
○ Similar to Artist, the Presenter table holds descriptive information about
presenters, such as their organization name, address, and contact details.
● EventType (Lu_EventType):
○ This lookup table provides details about the types of events. It can be used to
categorize and analyze events based on their types.
● GenreType (Lu_GenreType):
○ This table helps in categorizing and analyzing artists or events based on genres.
● ActType (Lu_ActType):
○ This lookup table helps categorize and analyze performances based on their type
(e.g., musical act, stand-up comedy, etc.).
● ContractStatus (Lu_ContractStatus):
○ This table could be used to analyze contracts based on their status (e.g., active,
closed, canceled).
3. Bridge Tables
Bridge tables can also exist in more complex schemas where many-to-many relationships need
to be resolved. Some potential bridge tables from your diagram might include:
● ArtistGenreType:
○ This resolves the many-to-many relationship between Artist and GenreType.
● ArtistActType:
○ This resolves the many-to-many relationship between Artist and ActType.
● BlueCardArtist:
○ This table likely links BlueCard with Artist and could serve as a bridge
between these two tables.
Summary
● Fact Tables: BlueCard, Contract, NationalOffer, ArtistProgramEnroll
● Dimension Tables: Artist, Venue, Presenter, Lu_EventType, Lu_GenreType,
Lu_ActType, Lu_ContractStatus
● Bridge Tables: ArtistGenreType, ArtistActType, BlueCardArtist
These identifications will help us structure our data warehouse efficiently, ensuring that we can
run queries and generate reports that are both meaningful and performant.
1. Agent-Related Analysis
● BlueCard Table: Analyze events managed by agents, including revenue, expenses, and
overall event performance.
● Contract Table: Evaluate contracts managed by agents, linking them to revenue and
financial performance.
● AgentPayment Table: Assess the payments made to agents and correlate this with
their performance.
● NationalOffer Table: Review national offers made by agents, assessing their success
rate and financial outcomes.
● ArtistFeedback Table: Analyze feedback related to artists managed by agents,
understanding qualitative aspects of performance.
● Presenter Table: Track the relationship between agents and their clients or presenters,
including retention and satisfaction.
Conclusion
Although there isn't a dedicated Agent table, agent information is dispersed across various
tables like BlueCard, Contract, AgentPayment, NationalOffer, and others. We can still
perform comprehensive agent-related analysis by joining these tables based on AgentId and
related keys.
This approach will allow us to gather a holistic view of agent performance, including revenue
generation, payment tracking, event management, and customer relationships.
2. Calculation Flows:
Here’s how these elements might work together in a typical financial transaction:
1. Gross Amount Calculation:
○ Start with the gross amount, which might be defined in the Contract or
BlueCard as the total value of the event or booking.
2. Agent Fee Deduction:
○ The agent fee is calculated based on the gross amount. This is either a
percentage or a fixed fee.
○ The fee is recorded in the AgentPayment table.
3. Artist Fee Deduction:
○ The artist fee is similarly deducted from the gross amount. This could be
predefined in ArtistPrice and recorded in the ArtistPayment table.
4. EventManagementCompany Commission Calculation:
○ After deducting the agent and artist fees, the remaining amount might be
considered for EventManagementCompany’s commission.
○ The commission percentage or amount is applied, and this is recorded in the
CommissionProgram or AgentCommission tables.
5. Final Profit Calculation:
○ The final profit for EventManagementCompany is the gross amount minus the
agent fees, artist fees, and any other deductions.
Conclusion
By linking these tables (BlueCard, Contract, AgentPayment, ArtistPayment,
CommissionProgram, AgentCommission), we can track the flow of money from the gross
amount down to the final commissions and payments made. This structure allows us to perform
detailed financial analyses, such as calculating profitability, evaluating agent performance, and
ensuring that all fees and commissions are accurately accounted for.
